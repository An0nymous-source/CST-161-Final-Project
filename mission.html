      <p>
        The club aims to connect students from different cultural backgrounds, nationalities, and heritage.
        The goal is to promote and celebrate the diversity that includes all cultures and to connect on a human level
        regardless of our differences.

      <p>
        We believe our club provides a space where students have the opportunity to share their culture and traditions,
        which helps to break the stigmas of prejudice, racism, and discrimination.
